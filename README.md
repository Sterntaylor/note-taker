## Issues
I couldn't get my save button working so I adopted some methods from this slyviaprabudy</br>
However I wasn't able to resolve my issue. My save button does not push note to DB.

I also checked repos of a few current classmates and I wasn't able to save on them</br>
either which led me to think it's an issue with index.js
